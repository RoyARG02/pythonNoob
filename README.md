Basic (with a sprinkle of advanced) programming concepts and syntaxes for a noob to get started with Python programming.
Code is well written and commented for understanding.

Pre-requisite: Some familiarity with computer programming in any language.

The concepts are divided as:
1. Basic(General Structure, print, input, suites, operators, import)
2. Conditionals and Iteratives(Loops and other control flow statements)
3. Data Types
   - Numbers, Strings, List, Tuples, Sets, Dictionary, Comprehensions
   - Special Functions(Data conversions and functions specific to data types)
4. Functions(Definition, Returning Values, Arguments, Lambda functions, functions working on lists)
5. Classes(Definition, constructors, destructors, inheritance, Attributes)
6. Modules(Command Line Arguments, Math, Random, Time)
7. Beware(PROCEED WITH CAUTION)
8. Test(Some sample programs I made which showcase one or two concepts discussed here)

Some references which helped me along the way:
- [Python 3 Basics Tutorial Series by Sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVp1vrfL_w4&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDe8XSftW-RAxdo6OmaeL85M)
- [Learn Python](learnpython.org)
- and of course, [Hackerrank](hackerrank.com), [GeeksforGeeks](geeksforgeeks.org), [Stack Overflow](stackoverflow.com) to name a few.


*P.S:
- Since I have some background with C/C++ programming, I may involuntarily compare some concepts discussed here with that of in C/C++.
- Please ignore the typos in the commented sections without making any faces. :P*
