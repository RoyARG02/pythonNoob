#python only supports single line comments, LIKE THIS ONE
'''the multiple line comments are actually a string literal spanning multiple lines
without any reference. This string object will be immediately deleted after the 
interpreter has executed it. It leaves on effect on the rest of the code, thus
functioning like a comment'''
